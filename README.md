# Install Hardhat and it's dependencies with yarn and compile the contracts with "npx hardhat compile"

# NFT Drop for Alumni of Nethermind

This project is tested on Remix but not on hardhat the test cases will be available soon

# Main Idea of the Project

The First ERC721-BST contract is a soulbound Non Fungible token that will be rewarded as a certification to the alumni

Alumni are not be able to transfer this NFT or Burn (although the burn functionality is added and can be removed depends on the use case)

The Creator(Organization) which is rewarding this NFT will have the authority to revoke the NFT at any time and trasnfer to their address back.

Another Idea which is not implemented yet is that we can revoke the NFT for some time if their is an inquiry needed and after a specific pericd of time that NFT will be again granted/transfered to the alumnus.

# Next Goal is to complete this project with different Idea on ERC-1155 which is in under progress,
